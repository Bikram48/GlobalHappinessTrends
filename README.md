# Analyzing Trends in Global Happiness and Its Correlation with Socioeconomic Factors

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the **Happiness Score** of countries based on key social and economic indicators. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from **Kaggle**, which includes several influential factors such as:

- **GDP per Capita**
- **Healthy Life Expectancy**
- **Social Support**
- **Freedom to Make Life Choices**
- **Perception of Corruption**
- **Generosity**

By employing **Linear Regression**, the project explores the relationships between these socioeconomic factors and a country's overall happiness score. The goal is to build a predictive model capable of estimating happiness scores for various nations and to evaluate the model's accuracy and performance.

## Dataset

The data used in this project can be found on Kaggle, which includes various social and economic indicators for countries around the world. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mrisdal/happiness-and-open-data/input).

## Key Features

- **GDP per Capita**: A measure of the economic output of a country, adjusted for its population.
- **Healthy Life Expectancy**: The average number of years a person can expect to live in good health.
- **Social Support**: The strength of social networks and community support available to citizens.
- **Freedom to Make Life Choices**: A measure of individual freedom to choose and make decisions in life.

## Methodology

The project utilizes **Linear Regression** to explore the correlations between socioeconomic factors and the happiness score. A model is trained using these KEY features, and the performance of the model is evaluated to assess its effectiveness in predicting happiness scores across different nations.

### Steps Covered in the Notebook:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the relationships between variables.
3. Building the Linear Regression Model: Training a model to predict happiness scores.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s performance and accuracy.
5. Results and Insights: Understanding the key trends and correlations.

## Notebook Report

All the details of the analysis, including the methodology, results, and insights, are comprehensively documented in the **Jupyter Notebook**. The notebook also includes visualizations and detailed explanations of each step in the project.

## Requirements

To run the project locally, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Conclusion

This project explores how various socioeconomic factors influence global happiness scores and aims to provide a predictive model that estimates happiness based on these factors. Through linear regression, we identify trends and correlations that can help us understand the key drivers of happiness in different countries.
